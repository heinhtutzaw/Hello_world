# Hello_world
just another repository
Hi everyone, my name is Hein Htut Zaw and I am learning how to use GitHub.
I interest in progamming and so, now I am learning C# with Solo learn C# app on android.
It is a good app and I really like it. If there is someone who want to learn C# or other programming language, I recommand to try it.
